# Sarcasm Detection
A Python application implementing a Sarcasm Detection Algorithm with Support Vector Machines. The training dataset consists of a list of news headlines in json format rating whether a headline is sarcasrtic or not.
This project has been implemented on python in Visual Studio 2019. If not using visual studio, open the .py files in the last directory separately, else opening the solution file in the main directory wil do.

The code has been divided into 4 files ranking from
1. News_Sarcasm_Detection.py
2. module1.py
3. module2.py
4. moudle3.py

Their description is as follows in the above order:
1. This file contains the filtering the dataset and reading it.
2. The code for reading the filtered data correctly and in a useful manner.
3. Training, testing and predicitng the model on a support vector machine (SVM).
4. Finally the the model sved and loaded in a windows GUI format using wx.

Example.txt contains some outputs from the test runs.
